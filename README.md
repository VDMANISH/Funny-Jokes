# Funny-Jokes
Random funny jokes.

😂 Here's a fun repository description :

Why did I create this repo? Because laughter is the best commit!

Welcome to the Funny Jokes Generator, where even your code cracks up! 
This project is designed to serve you fresh, random jokes with every click—because who said developers can't be funny?

# Features:
1) Randomized jokes that may or may not improve your debugging experience! 🐞
2) Jokes so good, even your compiler will throw a "laugh-out-loud" exception! 😜
3) Perfect for procrastinating or giving your brain a break after hours of staring at code! 💻
# How to Use:
- Clone the repo. Get ready to LOL.
- Run the joke generator and watch your terminal giggle.
- Laugh, cry, or stare in disbelief at how punny it is.
- Want more? Just run it again and get a new joke every time!
# Warning:
- Overuse may cause excessive laughter and an increase in bad puns! 😆
- Your colleagues might question your sanity after hearing these jokes.
